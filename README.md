- 👋 Hi, I’m @ltrenary
- 👀 I’m interested in developing and applying statistical methods to advance our understanding of the climate science and predictability. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning methods for climate prediction.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to impacts of climate change on extreme events, climate prediction across timescales, and better 
     understanding of the ocean role in driving climate variations.
